Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a robust predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on a set of input features. The model used in this project is LightGBM, which was selected after careful comparison with other algorithms.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data splitting.

Model Selection: Exploration of various machine learning models with a focus on LightGBM.

Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model to optimize performance and avoid overfitting.

Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of 97%, making it a reliable tool for predicting diabetes. The model's performance was carefully assessed to ensure that it generalizes well to new data without overfitting.
